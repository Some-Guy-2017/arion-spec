\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
This document details the planned implementation of the flashcard spaced repetition software Arion.
It describes the functional and non-functional requirements of the system, providing documentation for users
and the software author.
It establishes prerequisites for the software to function, and outlines the planned life cycle of the product.

\section{Document Conventions}
This document was created based on a Latex template for Software Requirement Specification documents that
respect the IEEE standard.

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Language learners, who want to use Arion to study new vocabulary or remember previously seen words.
    \item Students, who want to memorize content for their classes.
    \item Programmers who are interested in furthering the software by developing it or
fixing bugs. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Scope}
Arion is a system used to memorize information. Users can create, manage, and study a list of flashcards.
Arion allows users to build their memory over time, allowing them to remember concepts over long periods of time.

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
Arion was built to be small and simple. \href{https://apps.ankiweb.net/}{Anki} is one of the most popular desktop
spaced repetition systems, but infamously has an unintuitive design.
Arion removes unnecessary features and has a simple GUI, improving user experience and making modification by users
with programming experience easy.
Arion is an open source, standalone application made for a senior year high school final project.
It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Language learners, who want to use Arion to study new vocabulary or remember previously seen words.
    \item Students, who want to memorize content for their classes.
    \item Programmers who are interested in furthering the software by developing it or fixing bugs.
\end{itemize}

\section{Operating Environment}

\begin{flushleft} % text does not fill the line, so must flush left to avoid error.
    Arion was designed to work on PCs with a Java Virtual Machine. \\

    It works on the following operating systems: \\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Windows Vista
        \item Windows 7
        \item Windows 8
        \item Windows 10
        \item Windows 11
        \item Mac OS
        \item Linux
    \end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
Arion is implemented in Java, using Java SWING and Abstract Took Kit (AWT) for the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
It reads and writes to the userâ€™s machine, and requires the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to be installed.

\section{User Documentation}
\begin{flushleft}
    A user guide is included in the Arion help menu. \\
    Arion has a user manual: \\
    \url{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R3L0F9FErr2sn22dniuIB0acMaw8OTUr/view?usp=sharing}
\end{flushleft}

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}
Arion is written in Java, so requires a JVM version of at least 17 to run.


\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Main Screen: The default screen that shows when the user first starts the program.
        It includes a study button that allows the user to enter study mode,
        and an add button that enters add mode.
    \item 
        Browse: A table listing the flashcards, with editable fields and allowing users to 
        delete entries. Back button allows users to return to the main screen.
    \item
        Study: Displays the flashcards and a bar with buttons. The bar either contains a 
        flip button to flip the card, or a correct button and an incorrect button that
        allows users to self judge their memory. Has a back button to return to 
        the main screen.
    \item 
        Sort: Has a drop-down allowing users to sort based on flashcard fronts or backs,
        and a drop-down for sorting in lexicographical or reverse lexicographical order. 
        Also has a button for confirming the sort, and a back button to return to the main screen.
    \item 
        Guide: A pop-up window with a number of screens, each detailing the usage of a
        different part of the program. Has an exit button to return to the main program.
    \item 
        About: A pop-up window detailing the Arion program, including its purpose and development.
        Has an exit button to return to the main program.
    \item 
        Add: A screen with two labeled editable text fields for users to enter the front and
        back of a new card. Also has a confirm button to add the flashcard to the list, and
        a back button to return.
\end{itemize}

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
Since Arion runs in a JVM, all hardware must be supported by Java.

\section{Software Interfaces}
Arion is written in Java, so requires a JVM version 17 or higher to be installed on the system.

\section{Communications Interfaces}
Arion is a standalone program, so has no external communications with other services.

\chapter{Other Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
$<$If there are performance requirements for the product under various 
circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the 
developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the 
timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific 
as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual 
functional requirements or features.$>$

\section{Safety Requirements}
$<$Specify those requirements that are concerned with possible loss, damage, or 
harm that could result from the use of the product. Define any safeguards or 
actions that must be taken, as well as actions that must be prevented. Refer to 
any external policies or regulations that state safety issues that affect the 
productâ€™s design or use. Define any safety certifications that must be 
satisfied.$>$

\section{Security Requirements}
$<$Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use 
of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define 
any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or 
regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
$<$Specify any additional quality characteristics for the product that will be 
important to either the customers or the developers. Some to consider are: 
adaptability, availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability, 
maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, 
and usability. Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when 
possible. At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes, 
such as ease of use over ease of learning.$>$

\section{Business Rules}
$<$List any operating principles about the product, such as which individuals or 
roles can perform which functions under specific circumstances. These are not 
functional requirements in themselves, but they may imply certain functional 
requirements to enforce the rules.$>$

$<$Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This might 
include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal 
requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections 
that are pertinent to the project.$>$

\section{Appendix A: Glossary}
%see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
$<$Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including 
acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans 
multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to 
a single project in each SRS.$>$

\section{Appendix B: Analysis Models}
$<$Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow 
diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship 
diagrams.$>$

\section{Appendix C: To Be Determined List}
$<$Collect a numbered list of the TBD (to be determined) references that remain 
in the SRS so they can be tracked to closure.$>$
