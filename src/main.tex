    A user guide is included in the Arion help menu. \\
    Arion has a user manual: \\
    \url{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R3L0F9FErr2sn22dniuIB0acMaw8OTUr/view?usp=sharing}
\end{flushleft}

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}
Arion is written in Java, so requires a JVM version of at least 17 to run.


\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Main Screen: The default screen that shows when the user first starts Arion.
        It includes a Study button that allows the user to enter Study mode,
        and an Add button that enters Add mode.
    \item 
        Browse: A table listing the flashcards, with editable fields and allowing users to 
        delete entries. Back button allows users to return to the main screen.
    \item
        Study: Displays the flashcards and a bar with buttons. The bar either contains a 
        flip button to flip the card, or a correct button and an incorrect button that
        allows users to self judge their memory. Has a back button to return to 
        the main screen.
    \item 
        Sort: Has a drop-down allowing users to sort based on flashcard fronts or backs,
        and a drop-down for sorting in lexicographical or reverse lexicographical order. 
        Also has a button for confirming the sort, and a back button to return to the main screen.
    \item 
        Guide: A pop-up window with a number of screens, each detailing the usage of a
        different part of Arion. Has an exit button to return to the main program.
    \item 
        About: A pop-up window detailing the Arion program, including its purpose and development.
        Has an exit button to return to the main program.
    \item 
        Add: A screen with two labeled editable text fields for users to enter the front and
        back of a new card. Also has a Confirm button to add the flashcard to the list, and
        a back button to return.
\end{itemize}

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
Since Arion runs in a JVM, all hardware must be supported by Java.

\section{Software Interfaces}
Arion is written in Java, so requires a JVM version 18 or higher to be installed on the system.

\section{Communications Interfaces}
Arion is a standalone program, so has no external communications with other services.

        \item Perform unit and system testing.
        \item Deploy Arion.
    \end{enumerate}


\chapter{Key Resource Requirements}

\section{Major tasks}
Since this is being developed by a single developer, all tasks are assigned to Joseph Hare.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Requirement documentation.
    \item Class and sequence diagram creation.
    \item GUI implementation.
    \item Back end implementation.
    \item Testing.
    \item User manual creation.
\end{itemize}


\chapter{Other Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item GUIs shall load within 10ms, otherwise Arion will feel unresponsive to users.

    \item Adding, editing, and deleting flashcards shall take no more than 5ms.
    \item Displaying flashcards shall take no more than 5ms.
        Since this process occurs frequently, a high delay would irritate users.
\end{itemize}

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Arion shall be modular and written in an object-oriented programming language,
        to allow for future updates and ease of creation.
    \item Arion shall be programmed in a portable programming language,
        such as Java, to allow for future porting to other systems.
    \item Arion shall be reliable and robust, so no unexpected inputs will
        make it fail.
\end{itemize}


\chapter{Appendices}

\section{Glossary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flashcard: A card containing a prompt on the front and information on the back,
        which is used to memorize information.
    \item Spaced repetition: a way to memorize information. New and difficult information
        is show more frequently than easy and older information, mimicking the pattern
        by which people forget information to optimize learning rate.
    \item Java: A multi-platform object-oriented programming language.
    \item Multi-platform: Able to run on many platforms without needing to alter the code.
    \item Object-oriented: a style of programming where data and code are organized into
        separate "objects."
    \item Graphical User Interface (GUI): A visible digital interface where users can 
        interact with the program using buttons, icons, etc.
    \item Java Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT): Java's first graphics toolkit, allowing developers
        to provide a GUI for their programs.
    \item Java SWING: A newer graphical toolkit for Java that can emulate the look of multiple platforms.
    \item Virtual Machine (VM): A computer implemented in software, as opposed to hardware.
    \item Java Virtual Machine (JVM): Java's VM used to run compiled Java programs.
\end{itemize}

\section{Analysis Models}
\image[0.4]{arion-use-case-diagram}

\section{Project Proposal}

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Traditional study methods often result in forgetting information over long periods of time.
Memorization over years, or even a lifetime, is crucial for
speaking a second language, entering a new profession, and many more scenarios.
A standardized approach to learning information is thus needed.

\subsection{Objectives}
Arion primarily aims to provide a spaced-repetition system to allow learners to 
systemically built their knowledge over long periods of time. \\
Arion's objectives are to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide a friendly user interface for managing flashcards.
    \item Be open-source to allow free usage of Arion.
    \item Work quickly and robustly for excellent user experience.
    \item Allow future cross-platform availability.
    \item Written in a modular way for future expansions.
    \item Written clearly using DRY principals for easy development and updates.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}
The development of Arion will following process:
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
    \item Create a detailed specification for the development process to follow.
    \item Detail the specifics of Arion using class and sequence diagrams.
    \item Implement the back-end of Arion (card creation, deletion, editing, etc.).
    \item Implement the front-end of Arion (the user interface, buttons, labels, etc.).
    \item Rigorously test the product using both unit and system tests.
    \item Create a user manual.
    \item Deploy Arion.
    \item Iteratively improving Arion with new features.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{History of Product}
Spaced repetition started in the \nth{19} century, when in 1885 Hermann Ebbinghaus
hypothesized that the rate at which people forget information increases exponentially
over time. Further study yielded the following two principals:
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
    \item Remembering the information leads to better memory than being shown the item.
    \item Remembering the information after a delay increases memory retention compared
        to recall soon after learning the item.
\end{enumerate}
The optimal strategy is to have learners review the information just before it will
be forgotten. Several estimations of when people will forget knowledge have been made;
Arion uses the Leitner system to temporally space flashcards, with the modification that
correctly reviewed cards appear again after $\lfloor 1.6^x \rfloor$ days
(where $x$ is the number of correct reviews).
